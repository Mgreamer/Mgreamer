Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Develop a game app that displays images as clues so a team can guess a phrase, title or thing which will work accross multiple platforms for the client the Gaming Room. The game must have one or more teams with multiple players. The game and team names must be unique and check if a team name is already in use. Only one instance of the game can exist in memory by having a unique identifier for each.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think my comparision chart was great and I included quite a few good points.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It gave me an idea of what I was going to do in developing the code. The UML diagram was the most helpful.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my choice of windows as an operating system and pick linux since it would be cheaper. I would then explain my choice in detail. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to consider the users needs based on what type of people will be using your application. If it is an application made for senior citizens to play a game it should be simple since many of them grew up without computers. If you are designing an application for a younger crowd more technical things can be including since many are computer savy. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached desigining software by deciding which operating system would be used. From there I decided which type of code would be the best. In the future in order to analyze and design a similar software application I would spend more time studying the code to be used ahead of time since much of coding can be forgotten if not practiced on a daily basis.
